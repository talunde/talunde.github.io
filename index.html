     			<p id="me"> Being from a small farm town, Wilbur, I find that I look at life a little more simply than most. I am super easy going, I look at most life situations positively and deem them achievable. I am energetic, outgoing, and known to always have a smile on my face. My work ethic is of a farm girl; always work hard and the day hasn't ended until the job is done. In my free time I love to go snowboarding, four-wheeler trips, camping and I love anything, and everything, about the water! I enjoy interior design, refurbishing furniture and home décor. I love getting dirty in my garden and fixing up anything around the house. What I love most about my hobbies is coming up with ways to make a living off of what I enjoy to do — entrepreneur at heart.
